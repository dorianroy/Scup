*** SCUP SOUNDCLOUD UPLOADER ***

[![Flattr this](http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png)](http://flattr.com/thing/2620/Scup-The-SoundCloud-Uploader)

Scup is a little AIR program that allows you to upload tracks to
SoundCloud from your desktop. You can get the current release 
version at <http://scup.dasflash.com>.

I created Scup to demo the SoundCloud-AS3-API and play around with 
Flex 4 Spark components and the Swiz Framework. Feel free to do the same
with this code. However, if you want to use it in your own project, you
have to comply with the GNU license, especially publish your code 
under the same license.

*** Setup instructions ***

In order to compile and run it, you'll need:

- Flash Builder 4 or another IDE that supports AIR and Flex 4 SDK

- The Soundcloud-AS3-API library
  <http://github.com/dasflash/Soundcloud-AS3-API>
  
- The Swiz Framework library
  <http://github.com/swiz/swiz-framework>
  
- Register your app at <http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new>
  to get a API key which you need to enter in
  com.dasflash.soundcloud.scup.model.ScupConstants.as
   
- In case you want to use the auto-update feature: set up a directory
  on a server to host your update files and put a updateConfig.xml
  file in the project root that points to your update URL. See Adobe's
  docs for details.
  
- I couldn't include the fonts of the release version for obvious
  reasons. If you don't have Interstate-Regular and Lucida-Grande
  installed on your system, you'll have to replace them in the Scup.css
  file with a font of your choice.
